#+Title: Hardened Systemd Unit for BIND 9
#+Date: <2021-10-16 Sat>

* Debian 11
 * This is an example of an hardened =systemd= unit file for BIND 9
   under Debian 11
   - This file has been tested under Debian 11.0 with BIND 9
     9.16.15-Debian (Stable Release). The file might need to be
     adjusted for newer versions of Debian or BIND 9.
   - The resource constraints in this example are for a typical
     enterprise or small/medium business DNS resolver or authoritative
     server. For high volume ISP level resolver the number of tasks
     and the memory constraints needs to be adjusted.
   - Store this file into =/etc/systemd/system/bind9-hardened.service=
   - Stop and disable the original unit
     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     # systemctl stop bind9
     # systemctl disable bind9
     #+END_EXAMPLE
   - Enable and start BIND 9 from the new unit file
     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     # systemctl enable --now bind9-hardened
     # systemctl status bind9-hardened
     #+END_EXAMPLE
   - If you run into issues with BIND 9, please verify the issue with
     the original (un-hardened) unit-file first before opening a
     ticket with Debian or ISC
